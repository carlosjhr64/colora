## DESCRIPTION

Colorizes terminal outputs.

Uses `Rouge::Formatters::Terminal256` to theme/color output to the terminal.
Color codes git diff.

## INSTALL
```console
$ gem install colora
```
## SYNOPSIS
```console
$ colora ./README.md     # Color outputs file
$ cat README.md | colora # Colorizing filter
$ colora --git lib       # Git-diff with target
$ colora                 # Git-diff default
```
## GIT-DIFF FILTERING

![Demo](img/demo.png)

Colora will decorate your git-diff output with the following additional flags:

* Absent: `*`
* Deleted: `<`
* Inserted: `>`
* Moved/Touched: `t`
* Edited: `e`
* Duplicated: `d`

The flags are the first three characters of the diff line,
the first coming from git.
The second and third refer to the code and comment of the diff line
(Colora assumes comments as in Ruby).
One can choose to filter(via command line options) the diff output to:

* Filter out context lines(quiet)
* Just view green(inserted lines)
* Just view red(deleted lines)
* Just view edited code or comments
* Just view duplicated code or comments

Additional features:

* Swap tabs with tab symbol
* Switch to a different theme(as provided by Rouge)
