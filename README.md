```

## GIT-DIFF FILTERING

![Demo](img/demo.png)

Colora will color code your git-diff output:

* Deleted: `:red`
* Replaced: `:magenta`
* Inserted: `:green`
* Edited: `:black`
* Moved/Touched: `:blue`
* Duplicated: `:cyan`
* Context: `:gray`

One can choose to filter(via command line options) the diff output to:

* Filter out context lines(quiet)
* Just view in(`+>`) lines
* Just view out(`-<`) lines
* Just view edited code or comments
* Just view duplicated code or comments
* Toggle on/off lines on regexp

Additional features:

* Swap tabs with tab symbol
* Switch to a different theme(as provided by Rouge)
